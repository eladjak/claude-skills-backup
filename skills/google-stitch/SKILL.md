# Google Stitch to Claude Workflow

Use Google Stitch for UI generation with Figma export, then Claude for logic.

## What is Stitch?

Google Stitch (stitch.withgoogle.com) is Google's free AI-powered UI design tool that:
- Generates complete UI designs from text prompts or images
- Uses Gemini 2.5/3 for generation
- Exports directly to Figma OR HTML/Tailwind CSS
- Supports mobile and web app interfaces
- Creates interactive prototypes

## When to Use Stitch vs v0.dev

| Use Stitch When | Use v0.dev When |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Need Figma export | Need React components |
| Mobile app UI | Web React app |
| Want to iterate in Figma first | Want code immediately |
| Need prototype linking | Need shadcn/ui components |
| Prefer Gemini's style | Prefer v0's React style |

## Stitch Workflow

### Step 1: Generate UI
```
1. Go to https://stitch.withgoogle.com
2. Enter a prompt OR upload an image
3. Choose mode:
   - Standard (Gemini 2.5 Flash): 350 generations/month
   - Experimental (Gemini 2.5 Pro): 50 generations/month, higher quality
4. Generate and iterate
```

### Step 2: Export Options

**Option A: Figma Export (for designers)**
```
1. Click "Export to Figma"
2. Edit layers, refine design
3. Once satisfied, export as code
4. Give to Claude for logic
```

**Option B: Code Export (for developers)**
```
1. Click "Export Code"
2. Choose HTML + Tailwind CSS
3. Copy code to Claude
4. Claude adds: logic, state, API, tests
```

### Step 3: Claude Integration
```
Give Claude the exported code:

"Here's UI from Google Stitch. Add:
- React state management
- Form validation
- API integration with [backend]
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Accessibility improvements
- Unit tests"
```

## Stitch Prompt Tips

**Good prompts:**
- "Dashboard for a kids educational app with progress charts and achievement badges"
- "Mobile app onboarding flow with 4 steps and illustrations"
- "E-commerce product page with image gallery and add to cart"

**Add context:**
- Color palette: "Use purple and blue gradient theme"
- Style: "Playful, kid-friendly with rounded corners"
- Platform: "Mobile iOS app" or "Desktop web app"

## Stitch Features

### Prototypes (New!)
Stitch now lets you link screens together:
1. Generate multiple screens
2. Use "Prototypes" feature to connect them
3. Create clickable prototype flow
4. Test user journey before coding

### Image Input
Upload existing UI to:
- Generate similar design
- Recreate in different style
- Get editable version

## Limitations

- Components may not always align perfectly
- Complex flows need human intervention
- No direct React component export (use v0 for that)
- Limited to Google Labs quota

## Cost

**Free!** (Google Labs experiment)
- Standard mode: 350 generations/month
- Experimental mode: 50 generations/month

## Comparison: Full UI Workflow

| Step | v0.dev | Stitch |
|------|--------|--------|
| Input | Prompt/screenshot | Prompt/image |
| Output | React + Tailwind | Figma + HTML/Tailwind |
| Edit | In v0 | In Figma |
| Claude adds | Logic, backend | Logic, backend |
| Best for | React devs | Designers, mobile |
